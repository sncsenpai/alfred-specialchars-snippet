# Special.Characters Snippet for Alfred

By now you can tell that I'm fan of the [Alfred][1] app as this is my second share of snippets. Whoop, whoop.

Now. This is different. As I previously said, I do technical writing. So... yeah... emojis won't look professional. But you may want to add the odd character here and there, like  (ahem) or ♣ (for those who like to play cards). And a couple of math symbols, like ≠ and π for good measure.

# Install instructions

1. Head over to [Alfred][1] to download the latest version of their app.
2. Download the latest snippets from the [Release][2] page, then open it.
3. In the import popup deselect (uncheck) the **Strip snippets of ‘auto expand’ flag** option.
4. Click the **Import** button.
5. Select (check) the **Automatically expand snippets by keyword** option.

# Usage

The snippets run with the prefix of `::`, followed by a short description, to minimise duplication with any other snippets/emojis, so I would suggest getting familiar with the list.

Some examples:

- `::divide` would give you `÷`
- `::degree_sign` would give you `º`
- `::arrow_dbl_left_right` would give you `↔`
